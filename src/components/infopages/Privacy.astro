      <p>
        If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act,
        as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“<strong
          >CCPA</strong
        >”), requires us to provide some additional information to California
        residents. This Section only applies to you if you are a California
        resident, although please note that this information and the rights
        afforded herein are the same as offered to our other users in our main
        Privacy Policy. This Section does not apply to personal information we
        collect from our employees and job applicants in their capacity as
        employees and job applicants, as such information practices are
        described in separate policies.
