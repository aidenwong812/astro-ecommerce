      <h2>
        All the terms that you agree to when you sign up for a Lexington
        product.
      </h2>
      <p>
        From everyone at Lexington, thank you for using our products! We build
        them to help you do your best work. There are millions of people using
        Lexington products every day. Because we don’t know every one of our
        customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to
        help keep the ship afloat.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are
        referring to <a href="#_">Lexington LLC</a>. We spun off Highrise HQ,
        LLC in the past, but it has since rejoined Lexington LLC.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we say “Services”, we mean our websites, including Lexington.com,
        hey.com, and Lexington.com, and any product created and maintained by
        Lexington LLC. That includes Lexington (all versions), HEY, Highrise,
        Campfire, Backpack, Ta-da List, and Writeboard, whether delivered within
        a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another
        format.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or
        organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services. We
        have specific ownership policies for our products: <a href="#_"
          >Lexington 4</a
        >, <a href="#_">Lexington 2</a>, <a href="#_">Lexington Classic</a>, <a
          href="#_">HEY for Domains</a
        >, <a href="#_">Highrise</a>, <a href="#_">Campfire</a> and <a href="#_"
          >Backpack</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) in the future.
        You can track all changes made since mid-2018 <a href="#_">on GitHub</a
        >. Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by
        linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a significant
        change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page
        and take any other appropriate steps to notify account holders.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the
        latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a
        right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are
        waiving that right or provision. <strong
          >These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account. That’s a
        broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We
        do our best to deserve that trust by being open about <a href="#_"
          >who we are</a
        >, <a href="#_">how we work</a>, and keeping an open door to <a
          href="#_">your feedback</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Account Terms</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
          password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The
          Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your
          failure to comply with this security obligation. We recommend all
          users set up <a href="#_">two-factor authentication</a> for added
          security. In some of our Services, we may require it.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our <a
            href="#_">Use Restrictions policy</a
          >, and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that occurs
          under your account, including content posted by and activity of any
          users in your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated
          methods are not permitted.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really
          free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for
          customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of
          trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in
          advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze
          your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If
          your account has been frozen for a while, we will queue it up for
          auto-cancellation. See our <a href="#_">Cancellation policy</a> for
          more details.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge
          your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of
          upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate
          starts from the next billing cycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
          taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on
          behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing
          authorities. See our <a href="#_">Taxes policy</a> for more details.
          Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or
          duties.
        </li>
        <li>
          We process refunds according to our <a href="#_">Fair Refund policy</a
          >.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within
          each of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked
          cancellation link. You can find instructions for how to cancel your
          account in our <a href="#_">Cancellation policy</a>. An email or phone
          request to cancel your account is not automatically considered
          cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can always <a
            href="#_">contact our Support team</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately
          upon account cancellation. Within 30 days, all content will be
          permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 60 days, all
          content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot
          recover this information once it has been permanently deleted. If you
          want to export any data before your account is canceled, we‘ve
          provided instructions for <a href="#_">HEY</a>, <a href="#_"
            >Lexington 4</a
          >, <a href="#_">Lexington 2</a>, <a href="#_">Lexington Classic</a>, <a
            href="#_">Highrise</a
          >, <a href="#_">Campfire</a>, and <a href="#_">Backpack</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up
          month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will
          not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused time in
          the last billing cycle. See our <a href="#_">Fair Refund policy</a>
           for more details.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any
          and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any
          time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will
          not be able to access the account or any content in the account.
          Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or
          your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of
          all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the
          use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this
          clause because statistically speaking, out of the hundreds of
          thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing
          something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against
          and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see
          our <a href="#_">Use Restrictions policy</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse
          or retribution) of a Company employee or officer will result in
          immediate account termination.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Modifications to the Service and Prices</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We make a promise to our customers to support our Services <a
            href="#_">until the end of the Internet</a
          >. That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer
          support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes
          it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign
          a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we
          decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any
          time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of
          our Services with or without notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do
          that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes.
          However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If
          we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via
          the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes
          on our websites or the affected Services themselves.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Uptime, Security, and Privacy</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these
          Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer
          service-level agreements for most of our Services — here’s <a
            href="#_">the one exception</a
          > — but do take uptime of our applications seriously. Visit <a
            href="#_">https://www.37status.com</a
          > to see the status of our Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage
          significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the
          Services. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before
          taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may
          negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups,
          redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data
          transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where
          we may send your data through our network unencrypted. Please refer to
          our <a href="#_">Security Overview</a> for full details and our <a
            href="#_">Security Response page</a
          > for how to report a security incident or threat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take
            that trust to heart. You agree that Lexington may process your data
            as described in our <a href="#_">Privacy Policy</a>
             and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the
            following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>To help you with support requests you make.</strong> We’ll
              ask for express consent before accessing your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an
                automated process partway through.</strong
              > We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix
              the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any
              personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum
              amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we
              aim to fix the root cause to prevent the errors from recurring.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To safeguard Lexington.</strong> We’ll look at logs and
              metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data
              and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access
              accounts as part of an
              <a href="#_">abuse report investigation</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To the extent required by applicable law.</strong> As a US
              company with all data infrastructure located in the US, we only
              preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government
              authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the
              Stored Communications Act, or in limited circumstances in the
              event of an emergency request. If a non-US authority approaches
              Lexington for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless
              the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us
              to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual
              legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Lexington is
              audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing
              information needed to complete the audit.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the
            necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
            technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all
            subprocessors who handle personal data for <a href="#_">Lexington</a
            >, <a href="#_">HEY</a>, <a href="#_">Highrise</a>, <a href="#_"
              >Campfire</a
            >, and <a href="#_">Backpack</a>, as well as a list of <a href="#_"
              >Company processors</a
            >.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Lexington is a
          “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to
          your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share
          with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in
          these Terms, the <a href="#_">Privacy policy</a>, and <a href="#_"
            >other policies</a
          >. We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information
          for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit
          permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your
          requirements under the CCPA and not use Lexington’s Services in a way
          that violates the regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          These Terms incorporate the <a href="#_"
            >Lexington Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”)</a
          > when the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or United
          Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) applies to your
          use of Lexington Services to process Customer Data as defined in the
          DPA. The DPA linked above supersedes any previously agreed data
          processing addendum between you and Lexington LLC relating to your use
          of the Lexington Services.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Copyright and Content Ownership</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright
          law. We provide details on <a href="#_"
            >how to file a copyright infringement claim</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you and
          your users in order to provide the Services to you, but we claim no
          ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to the
          Services remain yours.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not pre-screen content, but we reserve the right (but not the
          obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content
          that is available via the Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and
          to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein,
          and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your
          use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written
          permission from the Company. You must request permission to use the
          Company’s logos or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please <a
            href="#_">email us</a
          > requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind any
          permissions if you violate these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit
          any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the
          Services without the express written permission of the Company.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Features and Bugs</h2>
      <p>
        We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the
        experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However,
        there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no
        guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or
        expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As
        with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the
        bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any
        related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and
        we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.
      </p>
      <h2>Services Adaptations and API Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We offer Application Program Interfaces (“API”s) for some of our
        Services (currently Lexington, Highrise, Campfire, and Backpack). Any
        use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses
        the Services, is bound by these Terms plus the following specific terms:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any
          damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party
          products that access data via the API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality
          is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or reports
          a Service user’s activity <em>other than time tracking</em>, both
          inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole
          discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this
          bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for
          the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove
          that integration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may
          result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s
          access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine
          abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your
          account’s access, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If
          your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access
          without prior notice.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Some third-party providers have created integrations between our
        Services and theirs. You can find some of those integrations for
        Lexington at <a href="#_">https://Lexington.com/extras</a> and for
        Highrise at <a href="#_">https://highrisehq.com/extras</a>. We are not
        liable or accountable for any of these third-party integrations.
      </p>
      <h2>Liability</h2>
      <p>
        We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one
        section:
